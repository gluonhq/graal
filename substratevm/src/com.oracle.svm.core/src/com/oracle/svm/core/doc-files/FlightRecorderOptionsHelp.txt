Usage: -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=[option[=value][,...]]

This option expects a comma separated list of key-value pairs. None of the options are mandatory. Possible option keys are as follows:

globalbuffercount=20       (Optional) Number of global JFR buffers. This is a legacy option.
                           This value cannot be changed once JFR has been initialized.
                           The default value is determined by the values for memorysize and globalbuffersize.

globalbuffersize=512k      (Optional) Size of each global JFR buffer. This is a legacy option.
                           This value cannot be changed once JFR has been initialized.
                           The default value is determined by the values for memorysize and globalbuffercount.

maxchunksize=12m           (Optional) Maximum size of each individual JFR data chunk.
                           This value cannot be changed once JFR has been initialized.

memorysize=10m             (Optional) Total size of all global JFR buffers.
                           This value cannot be changed once JFR has been initialized.

repositorypath=...         (Optional) Path to the location where JFR recordings are stored until they are
                           written to a permanent file.
                           The default location is the temporary directory for the operating system.

stackdepth=64              (Optional) Stack depth for stack traces.
                           Setting this value greater than the default may cause a performance degradation.
                           This value cannot be changed once JFR has been initialized.

thread_buffer_size=8k      (Optional) Size of each thread-local JFR buffer.
                           This value cannot be changed once JFR has been initialized.

preserve-repository=false  (Optional) Preserve files stored in the disk repository after the process exits.
